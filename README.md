"# Medieval2_Mod" 

This mod adds a new a-historical faction "Irinia".

Irinia has a new kind of army, separate from other factions.
It has gunpowder units available from the start of the game and utilises pikemen more than any other faction.

In contrast it has no access to heavy infantry and very limited access to cavalry.

All faction units were repurposed from other factions, none were created by myself.
